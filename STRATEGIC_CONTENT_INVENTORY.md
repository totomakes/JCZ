## 2. Home Page (01 / SYSTEM)

### Hero Section
- **Headline**: BUILD THE AUTHORITY. OWN THE CATEGORY.
- **Sub-headline (Brand)**: JUAN CARLOS ZERMEÑO
- **Narrative**: I help founders and high-stakes organizations exit the commodity trap. This is not about marketing; it's about the precision architecture of perceived value. Build a legacy, not a profile.
- **Primary CTA**: APPLY TO WORK TOGETHER
- **Secondary CTA**: VIEW CASE STUDIES

### Problem Analysis
- **Section Title**: THE COST OF INVISIBILITY
- **Analysis Body**: Most "authorities" are actually just loud commodity providers. If you are competing on price, your positioning is broken. If your founder identity is under-leveraged, your scale is capped.
- **Pain Points**:
  - Weak Positioning
  - Price Wars
  - Inconsistent Presence
  - Low-Value Leads

### Identity Selection (Narrative Paths)
- **Selection Title**: SELECT YOUR NARRATIVE PATH
- **Path 1**: BUILD MY PERSONAL AUTHORITY (Transform from industry expert to the indisputable category leader.)
- **Path 2**: SCALE MY COMPANY BRAND (Leverage founder identity to drive enterprise-level trust and velocity.)
- **Path 3**: ENTER THE LUXURY TIER (Exit the price wars and position your offer as a high-intent investment.)
- **Path 4**: BUILD A PERFORMANCE ENGINE (Systematize authority distribution to ensure consistent strategic flow.)

### Qualification Filter
- **Filter Title**: WHO THIS IS NOT FOR
- **Exclusion List**:
  - Short-term thinkers looking for "quick hacks."
  - Commodity providers afraid of bold positioning.
  - Founders unwilling to invest in cinematic quality.
- **Closing Internal Quote**: "Authority is not granted. It is claimed through strategic design and relentless execution."
- **Final Home CTA**: PROCEED TO APPLICATION

## 4. Method (03 / METHOD)

### Section Intro

## 5. Thesis (04 / THESIS)

### Major Quote
- **Quote**: "THE ULTIMATE DIFFERENTIATOR IS NOT WHAT YOU DO, BUT WHO YOU ARE PERCEIVED TO BE."

### Pillar 01: PRODUCTION IS A COMMODITY
- **Detail**: High-quality video and design are the table stakes. They are no longer a differentiator. Without the underlying architecture of authority, you are just making expensive noise.

### Pillar 02: AUTHORITY IS ENGINEERED
- **Detail**: Status is a technical challenge. We map the psychological journey of your target market and ensure every visual and verbal cue reinforces your position at the top.

### Pillar 03: RADICAL EXCLUSIVITY
- **Detail**: The most powerful position in any market is "hard to reach." We build systems that elevate you while filtering for high-intent, low-friction clients.
